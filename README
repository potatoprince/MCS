This project contains a collection of various scripts used in Mikrotik router consoles.

Scripts are self explanatory and in the event when there's more than 2 or 3 boards to test, just copy the scripts from previous # boards and increment the values by 1 etc.

Also, the IP addresses used in ping check and fetch commands are my own local ones, so change them appropriately.
